I was born in Bergamo, Italy, in 1994.

I'm a **postdoc** researcher at [Universit√† degli Studi di
Bergamo](https://en.unibg.it/). My research group is [Unibg
Seclab](https://seclab.unibg.it/). We focus on several areas such as
system security (Linux, Android), security for data warehouses, access
control, data outsourcing and privacy.

# Background and competences

I received the PhD in Engineering and Applied Sciences (area: Computer
Science) in 2022, with a thesis on *Technologies for the secure
collection, sanitization, processing and release of data*. My advisor
was Prof. Stefano Paraboschi.

The PhD is a fundamentally different **experience** compared to a
Master or Bachelor degree. During this journey I learned to work on
complex topics, in which I often had no previous knowledge, nor
predetermined goals. I also learned how to experiment ideas developing
small prototypes, write scientific papers, give presentations, and
evaluate the feasibility of new approaches to a problem.

There are 3 **software** that I use frequently: `Emacs`, `Git`,
`Make`. Scientific papers are always formatted in `LaTeX`, and
prototypes mostly implemented in `Python`. Every time I have the
opportunity, I try to implement new tools in `Go`, which is my
favorite programming language.
<br>
Occasionally, I have also written code in -- Rust, C++, Java, SQL, C,
Elisp, Javascript, M4, TE, CIL, ODRL, RDF;
<br>
and used these software/frameworks -- Landlock, Seccomp, BPF,
Docker, Postgres, Redis, Deno, Bazel, Apache Spark, FRESCO mpc, Z3,
FUSE.

From time to time I update a public version of my
[.emacs.d](https://github.com/dariofad/dot-emacs) configuration files.
