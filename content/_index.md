I'm an [Assistant Professor](https://seclab.unibg.it/) specializing in
the integration of security features into various systems, including
runtimes and cloud apps. I enjoy experimenting with programming
languages, operating systems (Linux) and sandboxing tools. I've also
had the opportunity to teach or assist at the university. In my spare
time, I'm learning Japanese.
