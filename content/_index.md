I'm an [assistant professor](https://seclab.unibg.it/) specializing in
the integration of security features into various systems, including
runtimes and cloud apps. I enjoy experimenting with programming
languages and sandboxing tools. I've also had the opportunity to teach
or assist at the university. In my spare time, I'm learning Japanese.
