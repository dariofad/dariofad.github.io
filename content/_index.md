I work as a [postdoc researcher](https://seclab.unibg.it/) at the
University of Bergamo, Italy. My goal is the integration of security
features in various systems like runtimes and cloud applications. I’m
interested in operating systems (Linux), application sandboxing,
access control methods, and backend programming.

Previously, I’ve been a teacher and an assistant for several
university courses. I also recently completed an internship at HENNGE
in Tokyo, where I worked on web application development.

I really enjoy the Japanese culture, and I visited many places in the
country.  I’m also studying the Japanese language, currently getting
closer to the JLPT N3 level.
