I'm an [assistant professor](https://seclab.unibg.it/) at the
University of Bergamo, and a visiting researcher at Kyushu
University. My research field is the integration of security features
into runtimes and cloud apps.

I enjoy experimenting with programming languages, sandboxing tools,
encryption techniques,
[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs), and my
[ergodox-ez](https://ergodox-ez.com).

I'm a japanese language learner.
