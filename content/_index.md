I work as a postdoc researcher at the University of Bergamo, Italy. My
goal is the integration of security features in various systems like
runtimes and cloud applications. I’m interested in operating systems
(Linux), application sandboxing, access control methods, and backend
programming.

Previously I’ve been a teacher and a teaching assistant for several
courses at the University of Bergamo. I also recently completed an
internship at HENNGE in Tokyo.

I really enjoy the Japanese culture, and I visited many places in the
country.  I’m also studying the Japanese language, currently getting
closer to the JLPT N3 level.
