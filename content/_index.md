I work as a [postdoc researcher](https://seclab.unibg.it/) at the
University of Bergamo, Italy. The goal is the integration of security
features in various systems like runtimes and cloud applications. I’m
passionate about programming languages, backend programming, operating
systems (Linux), and application sandboxing.

In my career I served as teacher and assistant for several university
courses. I recently completed an internship at HENNGE in Tokyo, where
I worked on web application development with AWS and Terraform.

I really enjoy Japanese culture, and I visited many places in the
country. I’m also studying the Japanese language, currently getting
closer to the JLPT N3 level.

I’m a big supporter of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
and I &#128155; [Ergodox-Ez](https://ergodox-ez.com/).
