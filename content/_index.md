My goal is the integration of security features in frameworks,
runtimes and cloud applications. Iâ€™m interested in operating systems
(Linux), sandboxing, access control, system and backend programming.

My hobbies are studying the Japanese language and culture, traveling,
taking long walks, and reading books.
