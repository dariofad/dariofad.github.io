## Laboratory of competitive programming

The goal of the course is to study and learn how to solve
**algorithmic** **problems** typically found in coding
competitions. The focus is mainly on understanding how to use
fundamental algorithms, data structures, and common approaches (or
patterns) to produce solutions with low computational complexity.
