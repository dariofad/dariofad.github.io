candidate](https://seclab.unibg.it/people) at Universit√† degli Studi di
Bergamo, Italy.

My work ranges from the integration of security features in mobile
systems, to policy and privacy management.  I'm really passionate
about operating systems security, especially topics like the
integration of access control techniques in legacy systems. I also
really like applied cryptography.

I'm a big fan of Emacs and of
[Ergodox-Ez](https://ergodox-ez.com/)."%}


In this blog I'll randomly share some cool stuff about programming,
Emacs, Linux and Android!
