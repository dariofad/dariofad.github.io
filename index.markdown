**Hi, I'm Dario**, a [PhD student](https://seclab.unibg.it/people) with Università degli Studi di Bergamo, Italy.

My work ranges from the integration of security features in mobile systems, to policy and privacy managment.
I'm really passionate about operating systems security, especially topics like the integration of access control techniques in legacy systems. I also really like cryptography.

I'm a big fan of Emacs and of [Ergodox-Ez](https://ergodox-ez.com/)."%}
