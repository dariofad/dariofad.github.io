"Hi, I'm **Dario**, a researcher and a [PhD
candidate](https://seclab.unibg.it/people) at the University of
Bergamo, Italy."

sub_description=

"My work ranges from the integration of security features in mobile |
database | cloud systems, to policy and privacy management. I'm
really passionate about operating systems (Linux, Android), especially
of access control techniques. I'm also interested in other topics like
programming languages, data structures, backend programming, and
applied cryptography.

I'm a big fan of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and of
[Ergodox-Ez](https://ergodox-ez.com/).

My non-work interests range from reading, planning new trips, and
learning the Japanese language."
